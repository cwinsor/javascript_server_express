Also there are notes on my blog at:

To run:

cd serverside/js
npm install   (will install express and nodemon)
node index_node.js
  and then visiit http://localhost:3030/
node index_express.js
  and then visit http://localhost:4040/

when editing files you can run  "nodemon" instead of "node" and that will continually restart if it sees a file change
